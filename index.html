<meta property="og:description" content="This video will remind you of the beyond the wall from Game of Thrones. 
Watch this cinematic travel video on a 4k or 8K TV for the best experience. I will be flying you through the Canadian Rockies, the beautiful sunset in Vancouver, the famous Lion's Gate Bridge, and amazing Day to Night Transitions across the province. 
British Columbia (B.C) is a western province of Canada. It's known for its beautiful snow-capped mountains. You will see the top places to visit in this beautiful province.
Each Day to Night Drone Transition took 4-6 hours of editing. Hope you like it."
